#### Introduction
A startup called **Sparkify** wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

#### Description
For this project, the task is to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions. This is part of the ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.


#### Datasets
The datasets have been made available and are present in the event data directory.

* event_data/2018-11-08-events.csv
* event_data/2018-11-09-events.csv
