#### Introduction
A startup called **Sparkify** wants to analyze the data they have been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app.  
The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.    

The task is create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. Need to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.
